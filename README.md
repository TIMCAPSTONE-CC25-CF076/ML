## Dataset
We created the dataset from scratch by manually specifying the variables using Microsoft Excel. Our data sources are YouTube and Ruangguru. The variables in this dataset include **Jenjang**, **Mata Pelajaran**, **Materi**, **Sub Materi**, **Link**, and **Pertanyaan**. The explanation of each variable is as follows:

- **Jenjang**: The stage of education, covering secondary education, namely Junior High School (SMP) and Senior High School (SMA).
- **Mata Pelajaran**: The name of the subject taught at the respective education level.
- **Materi**: The main chapter or subject area within a given subject.
- **Sub Materi**: A more specific part or subsection of a topic that covers detailed aspects of the main topic.
- **Link**: A link to the learning video from YouTube and Ruangguru.
- **Pertanyaan**: Items or questions designed to assess students' understanding of the specific Subtopic being studied.

In addition, we also created a mission dataset containing daily tasks that students must complete to support the continuity of the learning process.
